The dataset comprises 200 rows and 8 columns, which represent various variables. Out of these 8 variables:
Species, Island, and Sex are qualitative or categorical variables, and they fall under the nominal data category.
They describe characteristics such as species, location, and gender. Year is a qualitative variable as well but
is of the ordinal type, indicating data in chronological order. Bill length in mm, bill depth in mm, flipper
length in mm, and body mass in grams are quantitative or continuous variables. They represent measurable
quantities like physical dimensions and weight.
Below is a flowchart that illustrates different categories in data. I have extracted 200 rows of data from the
original penguin data set, which originally consisted of 333 entries. This subset of data has been selected
for the purpose of conducting data analysis and exploration. Penguins are categorized into two sexes, male
and female, and further classified based on three different islands and three distinct species.
